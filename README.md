About!

Hello! I'm Cecilie, a 30-year-old front-end student who's currently halfway through my journey of studying front-end. I'm on a mission to create visually and user-friendly websites.

My passion for web development started a while back,
and as I've progressed through my studies, I have worked with
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's been an exciting and rewarding journey,
and I can't wait to see where it takes me next.

As I continue my studies and approach the finish line, I'm excited to take on new challenges and opportunities in the world of web development.
