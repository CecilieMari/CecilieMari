About!

Hello! I'm Cecilie, a 30-year-old front-end developer who's currently halfway through my journey of studying front-end. I'm on a mission to create visually stunning and user-friendly websites that leave a lasting impression.

My passion for web development was sparked a while back, and as I've progressed through my studies, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end technologies. It's been an exciting and rewarding journey, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next.

As I continue my studies and approach the finish line, I'm excited to take on new challenges and opportunities in the world of web development. If you have any questions or are interested in collaborating on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for front-end design.
